Number-Guessing Game
A simple terminal-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and n. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the chosen number is too low or too high. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, at which point they receive a congratulatory message.
